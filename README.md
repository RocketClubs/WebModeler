#Rocket Clubs Web Modeler

The goal of this project is to make creating and sharing rocket models available in the browser.

###Building

The only thing that currently needs to be built is the CSS.  Upon cloning, you will need to compile the `layout.less` file.

###Using

Once you have built the CSS, load up default.htm in a browser.
